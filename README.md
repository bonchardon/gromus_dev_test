A brief report: 

1) API used: https://flaidata.tiktok-alltrends.com:442/swagger/index.html?urls.primaryName=Datapoint
2) the overall project is in the repository gromus_dev_test (build the HTML/CSS/JavaScript, used the API needed, used Flask web framework, etc.).

Thanks for the task, it was fun! Would be happy to hear any comments.
